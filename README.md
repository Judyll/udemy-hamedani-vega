ASP.NET Core is the next generation of ASP.NET MVC. It's a complete re-write of this framework but in a modular, cloud-optimized and cross-platform way. So it can run on Windows, Linux and Mac. If you're on Mac or Linux and want to build ASP.NET applications without running Windows in a virtual machine, you're going to love ASP.NET Core! You can use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or your favorite code editor to build ASP.NET Core applications with C#. Say goodbye to VMWare, Parallels, and other virtualization software. 

Many companies have already started building their new applications with ASP.NET Core. And they're asking their new interviewees if they are familiar with .NET Core. So, whether you want to stay in the marketplace and get a better job with better pay, or you just love to work with the latest technology, it's time to learn about ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. 

In this course, Mosh, author of several highly rated courses on Udemy, teaches you how to build a real-world application with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core and Angular. If you're familiar with ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6 and are looking for a course to quickly get up to speed with .NET core, this is the course for you. Not only will you learn about the changes and the new tooling in ASP.NET Core, you'll also learn how to properly integrate it with Angular to build real-world single page applications (SPAs).
